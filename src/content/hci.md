# Human-Computer Interation: Introduction and Design Methods

![Human-Computer Interaction History](https://miever.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/static/blogs/Human-Computer-Interaction-Timeline.png)

## Introduction to HCI - Chapter 1

### Human-Computer Interaction(HCI)

The HCI discipline is concerned with the design of computer systems that help people to perform their activities productively and safely.

### Interaction Design

Interaction Design is about designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives(includes UX).

Interaction design aims to:
    
* Create and develop usable product(Usability: easy to use, effective, good experience, etc).
* include users along the process.

### Usability

The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.

### User Experience

The overall experience of a person using a product such as a website or computer application, especially in terms of how easy or pleasing it is to use. (Involving Emotions)

### User Centered Design - UCD

User Centered Design is an iterative process in which designers focus on the users and their needs in each phase of the design process.

Human-centred design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, and usability knowledge and techniques.

### User Centered Design Principles

* The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments(Context Of Use)
* Users are involved throughout design and development
* The disign is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation.
* The process is iterative
* The design addresses the whole user experience.
* The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.

### UCD Process

## Usability - Chapter 2

The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.

### Usability Attributes

* Effective to use(Effectiveness)
* Efficient to use(Efficiency)
* Save to use (Safety)
* Having good utility(Utility)
* Easy to learn(Learnability)
* Easy to remember(Memorability)
* Satisfaction

| Usability Attribute's Name | Definition | Metrics |
|----------------------------|------------|---------|
| Effectiveness | Effectiveness is a very general goal and refers to how good a product is at doing what it is supposed to do. | <ul><li>Percentage of users completing the tasks in a correct way </li><li>Number of times users do not complete the tasks or need to repeat a task</li></ul> |
| Efficiency | Efficiency is a relationship between results achieved(outputs) and resources used(inputs). | <ul><li>Number of task per time unit (Expert User)</li><li>Average time per task</li></ul> |
| Safety | Safety involves protecting the user from dangerous conditons and undesirable situations. | <ul><li>Errors frequency</li><li>Level of understanding of errors' message(Through observation or questionnaire)</li><li>Undo mechanism</li></ul> |
| Utility | Utility refers to the extent to which the product provides the right kind of functionality so that users can do what they need ot want to do. | <ul><li>Observing frustraction or questionnaire about new functionalities</li></ul> |
| Learnability | Learnability refers to how easy a system is to learn to use. | <ul><li>Time for a novel use to get the productivity level of an expert user</li></ul> |
| Memorability | Memorability refers to how easy a product is to remember how to use, once learned. | <ul><li>Number of errors when using the system after a while</li></ul> |
| Satisfaction | User's level of enjoyment and positive attitude towards the product | Questionnaires |

## Human Factors - Chapter 3

Types of Human Factors

* Ergonomics
* Human Information Processing Model
* Memory
* Thinking
* Perception and Manipulation
* Errors and Mental Models
* Metaphors

### Information Processing

1. Perceptual Processor

The perceptual processor senses, detects, and accepts inputs from the external world and stores parts of the perceptions in working memory (these are visual or auditory)

2. Cognitive Processor

The cognitive processor interprets, manipulates, and makes decisions about the inputs (along with memory)

3. Motor Processor

The motor processor generates physical actions (such as keying and mouse clicking) based on perceptions and cognitions

## Interaction Styles and Devices - Chapter 4

### Interaction Devices

Hardware elements allowing to carry out the interaction.

### Types Of Interactive Styles

* Command-based interfaces: Origins
* Command-based interface: Natural language
* Menus & Forms
* Direct Manipulation

## User Centered Design - Chapter 5

UCD is an iterative process in which designers focus on users and their needs in each phase of the design process. In UCD, design teams involve users throughout the design process via a variety of research and design techniques, to create highly usable and accessible products for them.

Human-Centered Design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the user, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, and techniques.

This approach enhances effectiveness and efficiency, improves human well-being, user satisfaction, accessibility and sustainability; and counteracts possible adverse effects of use on human health, safety and performance.

### User Centered Design Principles

* The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments(Context of Use)
* Users are involved throughout the design and development
* The design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation
* The process is iterative
* The design addresses the whole user experience
* The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives 

### Context of User(UCD Principle 1 - The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments)

* Products should be designed with people's real needs in mind.
* The degree of usability and accessibility of a product depends on the context of use. 

Users achieve specific goals by performing specific tasks in a specific environment(Users, Tasks and Environments)

### Active user involvement(Principle 2 - Users are involved throughout the design and development)

Benefits:

* Allows the solution to be designed according to the real needs of the users
* Allows you to evalute whether the mental model of users and designed solution fit
* Reduces time and costs
* Reduces chance of failure(Improves acceptance and usability)

### Evaluation - Driven Design (Principle 3 - The design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation)

* User feedback is a critical source of information(Drives iterative design)
* Evaluation with users during the process allows
    * Reducing the risk of not meeting users' needs
    * Realisically testing preliminary designs(Identifying usability issues)
* The final system must also be evaluated(Even once installed and in use)

### Iterative Process(Principle 4 - The process is iterative)

Iteration is necessary for good design. The reaction of users to the system can not be known 100% in advance

All process phases are reviewed and refined based on evaluation

### Design for User Experience (Principle 5 - The design addresses the whole user experience)

Design for the complete user experience

* System: presentation, functionality, performance, behavior, ability to help
* User: User: experience, attitude, skills, habits, personality...

Distribution of user-system tasks, we have different capabilities:

* Taking into account multiple factors
* Human factors
* Accessibility
* Design Heuristics

### Multidisciplinary design teams (Principle 6 - The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspective)

The complexity of human participation requires experts in multiple areas: Cognitive psycholoy、Sociology、Authropology、Computer Science

## Ethical and regulatory aspects - Chapter 6

Research is not a totally neutral activity, so it must comply with legal and ethical standards to be carried out.

The analysis of the context of use must be considered a research with human beings.

### Nuremberg Code: Principles

* Voluntary Consent is Essential
* The Experiment Must Yield Benificial Results
* Prior Research and Knowledge Must Support the Experiment
* Avoid Unnecessary Physical and Mental Suffering
* No Experiment If Death or Injury Is Expected
* Risks Should Be Proportional to the Benefits
* Adequate Preparation and Facilities Must Be in Place
* Conducted Only by Qualified Personnel
* Participants Can Withdraw At Any Time
* The Experimenter Must End the Experiment If Harm Occurs

### Informed Consent

Key aspects:

* Compliance with current legislation (GDPR, LO 3/2018, Law 41/2002, Law 14/2007)
* Information must be clear and understandable
* Information must be transmitted both orally and in writing
    * Subject must keep a copy signed by the main researcher, and main researcher a copy signed by the subject


## User Research. Context of Use  - Chapter 7

### User Analysis

Main aspects to analyse:

* Psychological
* Physical
* Knowledge and abilities
* Preferences
* Position and Responsibilities in the company
* Relationships with colleagues/objects

#### Purposes of User Analysis

* Understand User Goal
* Identify User Pain Points
* Collect Behavioral Insights
* Define Requirements for a new solution
* Ensure the solution is User-Centered

Overall Goal: The system must be designed so that it 'completely' satisfies the users, and then it is necessary to understand them throughly

### Task Analysis

Task analysis in UX means detailed mapping of how a user completes their goal using a digital product and of dependent system actions

Main aspects to be analysed:

* Hierarchy
* Goal of the task
* Prerequisites
* Required and generated information
* Dependencies
* Problems
* ...

The System will be used to perform specific tasks, and then it is necessary to define them thoroughly.

### Enviroment analysis

The process of assessing and interpreting the information gathered through social, technological and physical envrionment

The system will be used in enviroments with specific conditions, and then it is necessary to take them into consideration.

### Qualitative Study

Qualitative study is a research method that focuses on understanding human behaviors and the motivations behind them by collecting and analyzing non-numerical data, such as text, video, or audio.

#### Qualitative Methods for Data Collection

Qualitative research relies on collecting non-numeric data. Key methods include:
	•	Interviews: Structured, semi-structured, or open-ended discussions to gather detailed information.
	•	Observations: Watching and recording behaviors in natural or controlled environments.
	•	Focus Groups: Group discussions to explore shared and differing perspectives.
	•	Case Studies: In-depth analysis of specific individuals, groups, or cases.
	•	Document Analysis: Reviewing written, visual, or audio materials (e.g., social media, journals, or reports).

### Qualitative Study Process

1. Research Design
2. Data Collection
3. Data Analysis
4. Validation of Data
5. Reporting Results
6. Ethical Considerations
7. Reflection

### Personas

Personas are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way.

* Personas are user models that are represented as specific human beings.
* They are not real people, but composite archetypes based on behavior patterns of real users.
* They capture the needs, goals, behaviors, and context of specific user groups.
* They allow us to think and communicate precisely how user groups behave, how they think, what they want to accomplish, and why.

#### Principles of User Personas

1. Specificity: Models a single person who stands for many
2. Personality: Provides enough detail to create a character
3. Authenticity: Derived from observations and real experiences


## Design Heuristics - Chapter 8

#### Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design

* Visibility of System Status

The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

* Match between System and Real World

The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world convensions, makeing information appear in a natural and logical order.

* User Control and Freedom

Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue.Supprot undo and redo.

* Consistency and Standards

Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.

* Error Prevention

Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

* Recognition Rather Than Recall

Minimize the user’s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

* Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

Accelerators—unseen by the novice user—may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. 

Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

* Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.

Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

* Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

* Help and Documentation

Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user’s task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

#### Navigation Map

The navigation map for the budgeting app provides a clear, visual representation of the flow between
key screens and pages, emphasizing how users complete the three core tasks. It serves as a blueprint
for understanding the app’s structure and user pathways.

Components:
* Boxes: Represent individual screens or pages within the app (excluding activities).
* Arrows: Indicate transitions or navigation paths, illustrating how users progress through tasks
or navigate between sections.

Key Features:
* Focuses on the most common transitions to ensure simplicity and clarity.
* Streamlines navigation, particularly for large or complex systems, enhancing usability and
efficiency.

#### Navigation Flows

Navigation flows illustrate how users move through the app to accomplish tasks and access features,
ensuring an intuitive experience.

Key components:
* Task Flow: Details the step-by-step actions users take to complete specific tasks.
* Wireflow: Combines screen layouts with navigation paths to show how users transition
between screens.
* User Flow: Maps the overall journey of a user, focusing on their interactions and
decision-making.

Together, these components provide a clear and structured view of the app's navigation, designed to
align with user needs and ensure a seamless experience.
