# The Evolution and UX Design of Racing Simulator Steering Wheels

This was my very first project using **Figma**! I explored the journey of racing simulator steering wheelsâ€”from their early days in the arcades of the 1980s to becoming must-have gear for modern esports players.

The project dives into how these steering wheels have evolved, focusing on key UX principles like **realism**, **durability**, and **customization**.
