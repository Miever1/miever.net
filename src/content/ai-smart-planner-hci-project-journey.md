# Building an AI Smart Planner with Mental Health Integration

## Project Overview

We developed an AI-powered task management application that integrates mental health tracking to help university students and professionals balance productivity with well-being. This project followed a full Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) process from concept to high-fidelity testing.

---

## Phase 1: Problem Identification & Context Analysis

### The Challenge

Our initial research revealed common struggles among users:
- Burnout from academic or professional workload
- Poor work-life balance
- Difficulty prioritizing tasks
- Lack of integrated tools combining productivity and mental health tracking

### User Research Methodology

We conducted 9 in-depth user interviews and observations.

- **Participants**: University students and young professionals  
- **Methods**: Structured interviews and contextual observation  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - 67% reported frequent feelings of being overwhelmed  
  - 83% didn’t use any task management tools regularly  

### Developed User Personas

1. **Alex – The Structured Planner**  
   Highly organized, relies on tools but struggles with unexpected changes.

2. **Sam – The Adaptive Worker**  
   Multitasker who dynamically shifts priorities and prefers flexible planning.

3. **Jordan – The Minimalist**  
   Avoids complex tools, relies on memory, often forgets tasks.

## Phase 2: Design & Prototyping

### Key Features Designed

- AI-driven workload balancing
- Mood-based task rescheduling
- Stress and burnout detection
- Voice assistant integration
- Conflict resolution through intelligent scheduling

### Prototyping Process

From low-fidelity sketches to fully interactive high-fidelity prototypes:

#### Low-Fidelity Prototype

## Phase 3: Usability Testing & Evaluation

### Methodology

- **Participants**: 6 users (male, aged 18–23)
- **Tasks**: 
  1. Creating calendar events with time selection  
  2. Logging mood and receiving suggestions

- **Instruments**: SUS questionnaire, UEQ survey, behavior analysis

### Key Findings

#### Effectiveness

- **High-fidelity prototype** had higher error rates than low-fidelity:
  - Avg. mistakes: 1.5 (high-fi) vs 0.6 (low-fi)
- Issues: Time selector usability, unclear optional fields, mood logging confusion

#### Efficiency

- High-fidelity: 18.83 actions (Task 1)  
- Low-fidelity: 13.6 actions  
- Root cause: Overly complex interaction design

#### User Satisfaction

- **SUS Score**: 86.25 (Very Good)
- **UEQ**:
  - Excellent: Perspicuity (2.33), Efficiency (1.79), Dependability (1.79)
  - Above Average: Attractiveness (1.50)
  - Below Average: Stimulation (0.92), Novelty (0.58)

## Phase 4: Insights & Recommendations

### Identified Issues

1. Time selector complexity
2. Missing visual feedback on system changes
3. Limited emotional engagement

### Proposed Improvements

- Simplify and redesign time selector
- Provide clear system status feedback
- Introduce personalized interactions and motivational visuals
- Optimize conflict resolution display

---

## Final Reflections

### Achievements

- Full HCI process: from research to usability testing
- High usability ratings with actionable feedback
- Effective team collaboration and timeline management

### Challenges Overcome

- Coordinating schedules for testing
- Managing complexity in high-fidelity design
- Converting user feedback into design improvements

### Future Work

- Enhance emotional design and visual appeal
- Further streamline user interactions
- Expand AI integration and improve transparency
- Conduct more diverse user testing across demographics
