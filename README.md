# Miever's Website

Everyone needs their own little spot on the interwebs, and this is mine.

Welcome to my personal website!

## Introduction
 
As a Front-end engineer, a descent personal website is required! It's been a long time that I want to build a personal website, but I always delay it because of some excuses, busy work for example. When it comes to the end of 2022, I realized that i need change. As you see, I'm changing.

## Project

The main purpose of this project is that I want to show my true self, here you can see my resume, blog, and other information about me. Of course, I also want to apply what I know in technology to my personal web page, if you want to know, please check out the source code.

## Building from Source

I used Gatsby to create my website. Gatsby is a React-based open source framework for creating websites. About how to use gatsby, please check out official documents [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs)
